---

ContraForce provides customizable email notifications for Microsoft Sentinel incidents, allowing you to configure alerts by severity level for each workspace. Keep your team informed about critical security events while filtering out noise.

<Info>
**Module Requirement:** Full notification customization is available with the **XDR + SIEM module**. The XDR-only module has limited notification capabilities (Gamebook notifications only).
</Info>

## Notification Capabilities by Module

| Feature | XDR Module | XDR + SIEM Module |
|---------|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| Sentinel incident notifications | — | ✓ |
| Severity-based filtering | — | ✓ |
| Per-workspace customization | — | ✓ |
| Gamebook completion notifications | ✓ | ✓ |
| Distribution group support | — | ✓ |

<Warning>
**XDR Module Users:** ContraForce does not generate email notifications for Defender XDR incidents. Use Microsoft Defender's built-in notification settings for Defender alerts. Deploying ContraForce will not interrupt your existing Defender notification configuration.
</Warning>

- ✅ High severity — Enabled
- ✅ Medium severity — Enabled
- ✅ Low severity — Enabled
- ✅ Informational — Enabled

### Configuring Severities

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Workspace">
    Choose the workspace from the dropdown
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle Severities">
    Click the toggle for each severity level to enable or disable
  </Step>

    Click **Save** to apply your changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Severity Level Guidance

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="High">
    **High severity incidents** indicate active threats requiring immediate response.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Active malware execution
    - Credential theft detected
    - Ransomware activity
    - Privilege escalation attacks
    
    **Recommendation:** Always keep enabled for all workspaces
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Medium">
    **Medium severity incidents** indicate potential threats needing investigation.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Suspicious sign-in activity
    - Unusual data access patterns
    - Policy violations
    - Reconnaissance activity
    
    **Recommendation:** Enable for most workspaces; disable only if generating excessive noise
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Low">
    **Low severity incidents** are often informational or low-risk events.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Minor policy alerts
    - Informational detections
    - Low-confidence alerts
    
    **Recommendation:** Enable based on team capacity and customer SLA
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Informational">
    **Informational incidents** are typically audit events or very low-priority alerts.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Audit log events
    - Configuration changes
    - Informational notices
    
    **Recommendation:** Disable for most workspaces to reduce noise; enable only for compliance requirements
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Per-Workspace Configuration

MSSPs managing multiple customers can configure different notification settings for each workspace.

### Use Cases

| Scenario | Configuration |
|----------|---------------|
| **Premium SLA customer** | All severities enabled |
| **Standard SLA customer** | High and Medium only |
| **Development/test workspace** | High only or disabled |
| **Compliance-focused customer** | All severities including Informational |

### Configuring Multiple Workspaces

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure First Workspace">
    Select workspace, set severity preferences, save
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch Workspace">
    Use the dropdown to select the next workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Adjust severity settings for this workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat">
    Continue for all workspaces requiring custom settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Document your notification configuration for each customer. This helps maintain consistency and simplifies troubleshooting when customers report notification issues.
</Tip>

## Email Notification Details

### Sender Address

All ContraForce notifications are sent from:

```
noreply@notifications.contraforce.com
```

<Info>
Add this address to your email allowlist and your customers' allowlists to ensure notifications aren't blocked by spam filters.
</Info>

### Email Content

Each incident notification email includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Subject Line** | Incident title with severity indicator |
| **Incident ID** | Unique identifier for tracking |
| **Severity** | High, Medium, Low, or Informational |
| **Description** | Summary of the security event |
| **MITRE Tactics** | Associated ATT&CK techniques |
| **Entities** | Affected users, devices, IPs, etc. |

</Frame>

The **View Incident** button opens the incident directly in the ContraForce Portal, allowing immediate investigation and response.

## Distribution Group Notifications

Route notifications to a team distribution list instead of individual users for better team visibility.

### Benefits

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Team Visibility" icon="eye">
    Entire SOC team sees all alerts in a shared inbox
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Missed Alerts" icon="bell">
    Alerts aren't missed when individuals are unavailable
  </Card>
  <Card title="On-Call Routing" icon="clock">
    Route to on-call rotation distribution groups
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ticketing Integration" icon="ticket">
    Use email-to-ticket systems for automatic tracking
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setting Up Distribution Groups

Distribution group notifications require setup assistance from ContraForce:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Email Address">
    Determine the distribution group email address (e.g., `soc-alerts@yourcompany.com`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide During Onboarding">
    Share the email address during initial workspace onboarding
  </Step>
  <Step title="Or Contact Support">
    For existing workspaces, email [support@contraforce.com](mailto:support@contraforce.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engineering Configuration">
    ContraForce Engineering team configures the distribution group
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification">
    Test that notifications are reaching the distribution group
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Distribution group changes require ContraForce support assistance. Self-service distribution group configuration is planned for a future release.
</Note>

### Common Distribution Group Patterns

| Pattern | Email Example | Use Case |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **SOC Team Inbox** | soc-team@company.com | Shared visibility for all analysts |
| **Customer-Specific** | customer-alerts@msp.com | Dedicated inbox per customer |
| **On-Call Rotation** | oncall@company.com | Routes to current on-call analyst |
| **Ticketing System** | tickets@company.com | Auto-creates tickets in ITSM |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start conservative, then expand">
    Begin with High severity only, monitor for a week, then gradually enable Medium and Low based on team capacity and incident quality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match notifications to SLAs">
    Configure severity settings to match your SLA with each customer. Premium customers might get all severities; standard customers might only get High and Medium.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use distribution groups for team visibility">
    Individual email notifications risk being missed. Distribution groups ensure the entire team has visibility into alerts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integrate with ticketing for tracking">
    Route notifications to your ITSM for automatic ticket creation, SLA tracking, and audit trails.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Allowlist the sender address">
    Add `noreply@notifications.contraforce.com` to email allowlists for your organization and your customers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review and tune periodically">
    Monthly review notification settings. If a severity level generates too much noise, consider disabling it while you tune detection rules.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Not receiving notifications** | Spam filter blocking | Add sender to allowlist |
| **Not receiving notifications** | Wrong module deployed | Verify XDR + SIEM module is active |
| **Not receiving notifications** | Severity disabled | Check notification settings |
