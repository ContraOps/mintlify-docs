**ContraForce Gamebooks for Identity Overview**

The ContraForce Gamebooks for Identity enterprise application is used to authorize Gamebook executions that target User entities. Specfically, the service principal requires User.ReadWrite.All and User.AuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All scopes. By default, the scopes are requested with a delegated permission type - that is, for use in on-behalf-of flows, which requires a signed-in user to be present. However, the service principal can also be granted application permissions that are able to run without a user present (except for Password Reset, which always requires use of delegated type permissions).
