**ContraForce's Microsoft Sentinel Hunting service principal**

ContraForce's Microsoft Sentinel Hunting enterprise application is used to call the Log Analytics API with the Data.Read scope. In the delegated, on-behalf-of flow, this allows ContraForce's Microsoft Sentinel Hunting enterprise application to send direct queries to a Microsoft Sentinel workspace on behalf of the signed in user. We use this for providing deeper incident context via raw event/"evidence" logs, and for running queries from the Microsoft Sentinel Advanced Hunting page.
