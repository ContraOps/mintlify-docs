## Setting Up a Shared Teams Channel with ContraForce Support

This guide walks you through configuring your Microsoft 365 tenant to enable a shared Teams channel with the ContraForce Success Team. Using shared channels allows direct collaboration without guest accounts or switching tenants.

## Overview

Microsoft Teams shared channels use B2B direct connect, which enables seamless collaboration between organizations. Once configured, you can participate in a shared channel directly within your own Teams environment.

## Prerequisites

- Global Administrator or External Identity Provider Administrator role in Microsoft Entra
- Microsoft 365 subscription with Teams enabled
- Access to the Microsoft Entra admin center

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Access Cross-Tenant Settings

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com)
2. Go to **External Identities** → **Cross-tenant access settings**

   Direct link: `https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/CompanyRelationshipsMenuBlade/~/CrossTenantAccessSettings`

### Step 2: Add ContraForce as a Partner Organization

1. Click **Add organization**
2. Enter the domain: `contraforce.com`
3. Click **Add**

### Step 3: Configure Outbound Access

1. Locate **contraforce.com** in your list of organizations
2. Click **Inherited from default** in the **Outbound access** column
3. Select the **B2B direct connect** tab
4. Configure the following settings:

   | Setting                   | Recommended Value | Notes                                                                             |
   | ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Users and groups**      | Allow access      | Select "Select users and groups" if you need to limit which users can collaborate |
   | **External applications** | Allow access      | Enables access to Teams shared channels                                           |
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Wait for Propagation

Cross-tenant access changes can take up to 24 hours to fully propagate across Microsoft's systems. If the shared channel doesn't appear immediately, check again the following day.

## Accepting the Shared Channel Invitation

Once your tenant is configured and ContraForce sends a shared channel invitation:

1. Open Microsoft Teams
2. Look for a notification about the shared channel invitation
3. Accept the invitation
4. The shared channel will appear in your Teams sidebar

## Troubleshooting

### Shared channel not appearing

- Verify B2B direct connect settings are saved correctly
- Confirm the changes have had time to propagate (up to 24 hours)
- Ensure the user accepting the invitation is included in the allowed users/groups

### Access denied errors

- Check that **Outbound access** is configured (not just Inbound)
- Verify **External applications** is set to **Allow access**
