title: "Roles & Permissions Reference"
description: "Complete reference for all ContraForce roles including organization-level and workspace-level permissions, use cases, and assignment best practices."
---

This reference provides complete details on all ContraForce roles, their permissions, and guidance on when to use each role.

<Info>
  ContraForce uses a two-tier role system: **Organization Roles** control platform-wide access, while **Workspace Roles** control what users can do within specific customer workspaces.
</Info>

---

## Role System Overview

ContraForce roles operate at two levels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Organization Roles" icon="building">
    Control who can access the platform and manage organization-wide settings. Assigned in **Settings → User Management**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace Roles" icon="shield-halved">
    Control what actions users can perform within a specific customer workspace. Assigned per-workspace in **Workspace Settings**.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Roles Work Together

A user needs **both** an organization role AND a workspace role to work effectively:

```
Organization Role → Grants platform access
        +
Workspace Role → Grants workspace-specific permissions
        =
Complete user access
```

<Warning>
  A user with an organization role but no workspace role can log in but won't see any customer data. A user must be assigned to at least one workspace with a workspace role to be useful.
</Warning>

## Organization Roles

Organization roles are assigned at the partner/organization level and determine platform-wide capabilities.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Apply principle of least privilege">
    Assign the minimum role needed for each user's responsibilities. Start with Incident Analyst and promote to Responder only when response capabilities are needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use groups for consistent assignment">
    Create organization groups like "SOC Tier 1" and "SOC Tier 2" with predetermined workspace roles. This ensures consistency across all customer workspaces.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Separate configuration from response">
    Consider separating Data Source Admin and Content Admin roles from incident response roles. This provides better audit trails and separation of duties.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limit Admin role assignments">
    Reserve the Admin role for personnel who genuinely need user management capabilities. Most analysts should be Incident Responders or Incident Analysts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document role assignments">
    Maintain a record of who has what role and why. Review quarterly to ensure assignments are still appropriate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use different roles for different workspaces">
    A user can have different roles in different workspaces. A senior analyst might be Admin for a premium customer but Incident Responder for standard customers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can a user have multiple workspace roles?">
    No, each user has one role per workspace. However, they can have different roles in different workspaces. If a user needs capabilities from multiple roles, assign the higher-privilege role.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Admin and Incident Responder?">
    Admin can manage users and modify workspace settings. Incident Responder has the same operational capabilities (investigating, responding) but cannot add/remove users or change configuration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should customer users be Organization Members?">
    Generally no. Customer users should only be added at the workspace level (not organization level) to ensure they can only see their own data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I create custom roles?">
    Custom roles are not currently supported. Use the predefined roles that best match your needs. Contact support if you have specific requirements not met by existing roles.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I promote a user from Analyst to Responder?">
    Go to the workspace settings, find the user in Users & Groups, edit their assignment, and change their role from Incident Analyst to Incident Responder.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What role should customer stakeholders have?">
    Incident Analyst is typically appropriate for customer stakeholders who need visibility into their security posture without the ability to take response actions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
