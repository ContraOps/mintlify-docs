## Overview

Within the ContraForce portal, you can find the Workspaces tab (3rd icon - Triangle) which displays all child tenants connected to a service provider's parent tenant. A key feature of the Workspaces page is to allow service providers to onboard their end customers to ContraForce in advance, streamlining the process for increased efficiency.

In this article, we will guide you on how to make use of the pre-onboarding feature efficiently.

Please ensure that the email address entered for the Customer Admin Email field is correct as this will be the email used to receive the ContraForce onboarding invitation email.

### 4. Select Configuration and Modules

![Select configuration](https://7831355.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7831355/POB%201.png)

If the end customer will be using XDR Modules exclusively, choose XDR under Configuration. Next, select the specific modules that will be utilized. In the example displayed above, both XDR + SIEM have been selected, so modules for both options are visible. Simply click on the name of each desired module to add it.

### 5. Save Pre-Onboarding Configuration

![Save configuration](https://7831355.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7831355/POB%202.png)

At the last step of the pre-onboarding process, you will see the chosen Configuration (XDR or XDR + SIEM) along with the selected modules.

Choosing to Save the configuration will store the settings configured for the customer. An email invite is no longer needed as when the user specified during the pre-onboard process signs into the ContraForce onboarding wizard, ContraForce will auto-recognize that the customer has been associated with the parent tenant.

### 7. Onboarding Wizard

After the customer has been pre-onboarded, sign into the ContraForce onboarding wizard (can be accessed here). Ensure that the user is a Global Admin and has the Owner role inside he customer's tenant. From there configure the pre-selected modules, and add users as needed.

### 8. Consent Enterprise Applications for the Partner

Navigate to the workspaces page, click the configuration sliders, and scroll down. Next to each ContraForce Enterprise Application, there will be a Consent/Enable for Partner button. Consent these for all options (screenshot below).

### 9. Toggle "Allow Gamebooks for Service Provider" and configure email notifications.

Navigate to Settings then Notifications. Configure notifications settings for the user that is signed in. Note that every user that has been added to ContraForce needs to go to the Notifications tab and click save.

Lastly, navigate to Service Provider. Toggle on "Allow Service Provider to run Gamebooks."
