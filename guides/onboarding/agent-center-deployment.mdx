The AI Agent Center enables you to deploy Microsoft Foundry infrastructure directly through ContraForce, powering automated incident investigation and response capabilities with Security Delivery Agents (SDAs).

<Info>
  Agent Center leverages Microsoft Foundry to provision the AI infrastructure required for automated security operations. Once deployed, you can configure Security Delivery Agents to handle incidents automatically.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Microsoft Foundry Infrastructure">
    Follow the on-screen prompts to configure and provision the Microsoft Foundry infrastructure in your environment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Your First Security Delivery Agent">
    Once infrastructure provisioning completes, deploy your first Security Delivery Agent (SDA) to begin automated incident handling
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                             | Possible Cause                 | Solution                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deployment fails                  | Insufficient Azure permissions | Verify Subscription Owner access                             |
| Agent Center not visible          | Missing ContraForce role       | Confirm Organizational Admin or Agent Admin role assignment  |
| Infrastructure provisioning stuck | Azure resource limits          | Check Azure subscription quotas and limits                   |
| SDA deployment fails              | Prerequisites incomplete       | Ensure AI Foundry infrastructure deployed successfully first |
