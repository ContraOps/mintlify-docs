# Deploying Agent Center

This guide walks you through the requirements and steps to deploy the ContraForce AI Agent Center, which enables you to leverage Azure AI Foundry infrastructure for automated security operations.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Agent Center, ensure you meet the following requirements.

### User Requirements

- **Subscription Owner** – You must have Owner-level access to the Azure subscription where the Agent Center infrastructure will be deployed.
- **ContraForce Role** – Your account must be added to ContraForce as either an Organizational Admin or Agent Admin.
- **Provisioning** – Users do not need to be separately provisioned within ContraForce to begin deployment.

### Required Tooling

- Microsoft Foundry (Azure AI Foundry)

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Access the ContraForce Portal

Navigate to [portal.contraforce.com](https://portal.contraforce.com) and sign in with your credentials.

### Step 2: Navigate to AI Agent Center

From the main dashboard, locate and select the **AI Agent Center** option to access the deployment interface.

### Step 3: Deploy Azure AI Foundry Infrastructure

The Agent Center deployment process provisions the necessary Azure AI Foundry infrastructure in your environment. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure your deployment settings.

### Step 4: Deploy Your First Security Delivery Agent (SDA)

Once the infrastructure is provisioned, you can deploy your first Security Delivery Agent. The SDA will handle automated incident investigation and response tasks based on your configuration.
