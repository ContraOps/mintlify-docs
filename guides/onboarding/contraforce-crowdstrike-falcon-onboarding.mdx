## Configuring the Workspace

On the ContraForce Workspaces page, the environment can be pre-configured for Crowdstrike. Start by adding the Tenant Name, Tenant ID, and Customer Admin Email for the account. Then select the XDR configuration and Crowdstrike will show as an option. More information about the Workspaces page can be found [here](https://docs.contraforce.com/knowledge/contraforce-workspaces-page).

## Onboarding Process

During the onboarding process, the ContraForce Onboarding Wizard will ask for the Instance URL of the Crowdstrike Falcon instance as well as the API Token generated for the ContraForce connection. After these values have been entered, the user can proceed with the onboarding process.

Additionally, during the onboarding process ContraForce will ask the user to consent the two main enterprise applications for ContraForce which are the ContraForce API and ContraForce Portal. Pop-up windows from Microsoft will appear during the deployment process. Documentation on the ContraForce API can be found [here](https://docs.contraforce.com/knowledge/contraforce-api-service-principal-1) and documentation for the ContraForce Portal can be found [here](https://docs.contraforce.com/knowledge/contraforce-portal-service-principal).
