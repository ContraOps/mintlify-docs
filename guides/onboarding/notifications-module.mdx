ContraForce keeps your team informed with configurable email notifications. Receive alerts when new incidents are detected, Gamebooks complete, or when issues require attention—all customizable by severity and workspace.

<Info>
  Notification capabilities vary by module. The XDR + SIEM module offers full customization, while the XDR-only module has limited notification options.

## Notification Capabilities by Module

Notification features depend on which ContraForce module you've deployed:

| Feature                             | XDR Module | XDR + SIEM Module |
| ----------------------------------- | :--------: | :---------------: |
| Sentinel incident notifications     | —          | ✓                 |
| Defender XDR incident notifications | —          | —                 |
| Gamebook completion notifications   | ✓          | ✓                 |
| Severity-based filtering            | —          | ✓                 |
| Per-workspace customization         | —          | ✓                 |
| Distribution group support          | —          | ✓                 |

<Warning>
  **XDR Module Users:** ContraForce does not generate email notifications for new Defender XDR incidents. Use Microsoft Defender's built-in notification settings for Defender alerts. ContraForce notifications are sent only for Gamebook activity.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Deploying ContraForce does not interrupt or override your existing Microsoft Defender notification configuration.
</Tip>

## Configuring Notifications

### Accessing Notification Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click **Settings** in the navigation menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Notifications">
    Click the **Notifications** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Preferences">
    Adjust settings by workspace and severity
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Direct link:** [Settings \> Notifications](https://portal.contraforce.com/settings/notifications)

### Severity-Based Filtering

For XDR + SIEM deployments, you can customize which severity levels trigger notifications:

<Frame>
  ![Notification severity settings](/images/notification-severity-settings.png)
</Frame>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="High">
    **High severity incidents** typically indicate active threats requiring immediate response.

    _Recommendation: Always enable_
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Medium">
    **Medium severity incidents** indicate potential threats that need investigation.

    _Recommendation: Enable for most teams_
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Low">
    **Low severity incidents** are often informational or low-risk events.

    _Recommendation: Enable based on team capacity_
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Informational">
    **Informational incidents** are typically audit events or low-priority alerts.

    _Recommendation: Disable to reduce noise, unless required for compliance_
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Per-Workspace Configuration

Configure different notification preferences for each customer workspace:

1. Navigate to **Settings \> Notifications**
2. Select the **Workspace** you want to configure
3. Enable or disable severity levels for that workspace
4. Save changes

<Tip>
  Use per-workspace configuration to match notification settings to each customer's SLA. High-priority customers might need all severities enabled, while others might only need High alerts.
</Tip>

Send notifications to a team distribution list instead of individual users.

## Notification Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with High severity only">
    Begin with High severity notifications enabled for all workspaces. Add Medium and Low severities gradually based on team capacity to avoid alert fatigue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use distribution groups for team visibility">
    Route notifications to a shared mailbox so the entire SOC team has visibility. This prevents missed alerts when individuals are unavailable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create email rules for organization">
    Set up email folder rules to automatically categorize ContraForce notifications by workspace or severity for easier triage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integrate with ticketing systems">
    Route notifications to an email address that creates tickets in your ITSM (ServiceNow, Jira, etc.) for automatic tracking and SLA management.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review and adjust periodically">
    Regularly review notification settings. If you're experiencing alert fatigue, consider disabling lower severity levels or refining detection rules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Allowlist the sender address">
    Add `noreply@notifications.contraforce.com` to your email allowlist to prevent notifications from being caught by spam filters.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrating Notifications with Other Tools

### Email-to-Ticket Integration

Many ITSM platforms support email-based ticket creation:

| Platform                    | Method                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **ServiceNow**              | Configure inbound email actions |
| **Jira Service Management** | Use email request channel       |
| **Autotask**                | Set up email-to-ticket rules    |
| **ConnectWise**             | Configure email connector       |

<Tip>
  For tighter integration, consider using the [ContraForce Partner API](/guides/technical/contraforce-api-documentation) or native integrations like [ServiceNow](/guides/technical/servicenow-integration) or [Jira](/guides/technical/how-to-integrate-jira-service-desk-to-contraforce).
</Tip>

### Microsoft Teams / Slack

For real-time team notifications:

1. Create an email-enabled channel in Teams or Slack
2. Use that email address as a distribution group in ContraForce
3. Notifications appear directly in your chat platform

| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Not receiving notifications**    | Spam filter blocking   | Add sender to allowlist           |
| **Not receiving notifications**    | Wrong module deployed  | Verify you have XDR + SIEM module |
| **Not receiving notifications**    | Severity disabled      | Check notification settings       |
| **Missing workspaces in settings** | Permissions issue      | Verify you have admin access      |

| **Too many notifications**         | All severities enabled | Disable Informational and Low     |

### Testing Notifications

To verify notifications are working:

1. Ensure notification settings are enabled for the workspace
2. Wait for a new incident to be detected (or ask ContraForce to send a test)
3. Check your inbox (including spam/junk folders)
4. Verify the email contains expected content
