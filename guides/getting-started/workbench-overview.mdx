The Security Workbench is your investigation and response command center. Visualize affected entities, build custom response workflows, and execute remediation actions—all from a single interface.

## What is the Workbench?

The Workbench combines investigation and response into one powerful experience:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI-Mapped Response Actions" icon="brain">
    Automatically recommended response actions based on affected entity types.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Entity and Context Graph Visualization" icon="diagram-project">
    See all related entities in an interactive context graph.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No-Code Queries" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Click-through investigation for entities  without writing queries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Workflows" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Chain multiple actions into comprehensive Gamebooks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  The Workbench is where investigation meets action. Instead of switching between tools, you can analyze the threat and respond to it in the same place.
</Info>

## Workbench Layout

The Security Workbench is organized into several key areas:

### Incident Header

At the top of the Workbench, you'll find:

| Element            | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incident Title** | Name and ID of the incident                         |
| **Status**         | Current state (New, Active, Closed)—editable inline |
| **Owner**          | Assigned analyst—editable inline                    |
| **Severity**       | Incident severity level                             |

<Tip>
  You can update the Status and Owner directly from the Workbench without leaving the page.
</Tip>

### Entity Graph

The central visualization showing all entities involved in the incident:

- **Users** — Accounts that were affected or involved
- **Devices** — Endpoints implicated in the incident
- **IPs** — Network addresses related to the activity
- **Files** — Suspicious files or hashes detected
- **URLs/Domains** — Web resources involved

Click any entity icon to:

- View entity details
- See other incidents involving this entity
- Access available response actions

### Tabs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Summary">
    Overview of the incident including description, timeline summary, and key indicators.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Entities">
    Detailed list of all affected entities with expandable details and cross-incident correlation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Comments">
    Team collaboration space. Add investigation notes and view comments from other analysts.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="History">
    Complete audit trail of all actions taken on this incident, including previously run Gamebooks.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Building a Gamebook

Gamebooks are response response workflows you build or agents can build by selecting response actions for each affected entity.

### Step 1: Select an Entity

Left-click an entity icon in the Entity Context Graph. The response actions appear already mapped to the entity type selected.

<Frame>
  ![Entity action carousel](/left-click-entity-graph.png)
</Frame>

### Step 2: Browse Available Actions

By click left-clicking entities, you will be able to utiliz the following response actions:

| Entity Type | Response Actions                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Invalidate sessions, lockout user, reset user password, and unlock user |
| **Device**  | Isolate device, run AV scan, unisolate device                           |
| **IP**      | Block Azure Network Security Group (NSG)                                |
| **File**    | Quarantine file, block hash                                             |

<Info>
  Available actions depend on the entity type and your connected modules. Gamebook response actions automatically map to actions that are relevant and executable.
</Info>

### Step 3: Add Actions to Gamebook

- Click the **\+ icon** to add a response action to your Gamebook.
- Hover over the action in the Gamebook and the **red - icon** will remove a response action.
- Repeat for each entity you want to take action on.

</Frame>

### Step 4: Review Your Gamebook

As you add actions, they load in the **Gamebook card**.

### Step 5: Execute the Gamebook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Response Actions">
    Verify all actions in the Gamebook are correct.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Run Gamebook">
    Execute all actions in the Gamebook.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Status updates from "Pending" to "Running" to "Finished".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Gamebook Approval Workflow

Some Gamebooks require approval before execution, indicated by a \*\*Approve \*\*button in the Gamebooks page or in the Gamebook within the Workbench.

<Warning>
  Actions with approval requirements are typically high-impact operations like device isolation or reset user password. This prevents accidental execution.
</Warning>

### Requesting Approval

1. Build your Gamebook as usual (including locked actions).
2. Click **Request Gamebook Approval** instead of Run Gamebook.
3. The request is sent to users with approval permissions.

### Approving Gamebooks

Approvers can approve requests from:

- **The incident itself** — Open the incident and approve directly.
- **Gamebook Activity tab** — Review all pending approvals in one place.

  <Frame>
    ![Gamebook Activity Approval](/images/gamebook-activity-approval.png)
  </Frame>


- **Gamebook Activity tab** — Review all pending approvals in one place.

  </Frame>

## Loading Previous Gamebooks

Don't rebuild from scratch—reuse successful response patterns.

### From the History Tab

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open History Tab">
    Click the **History** tab in the Security Workbench
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Previous Gamebook">
    Browse previously executed Gamebooks for this incident
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load Gamebook">
    Click to load the actions into a new Gamebook
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify if Needed">
    Add or remove actions before executing
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  ![Gamebook History tab](/images/gamebook-history-tab.png)
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Loading previous Gamebooks is especially useful for recurring incident types. Build a response once, reuse it across similar incidents.
</Tip>

---

## Gamebook Activity Page

Track all Gamebook executions across your entire environment from the dedicated **Gamebooks Page**.

<Frame>
  ![Gamebook Activity page](/images/gamebook-activity-page.png)

### Expanding Details

Click any row to expand and see:

- Individual action results
- Error messages (if any failed)

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with high-impact entities">
    Focus your initial response on the most critical entities—compromised users, infected devices, or malicious IPs that pose immediate risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use comments to document findings">
    Add comments as you investigate. This creates a record for your team and helps with post-incident review.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review before executing">
    Always review the complete Gamebook Card before clicking Run. Verify you're taking action on the correct entities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check History for patterns">
    Before building a new Gamebook, check the History tab. A previous response may already exist that you can reuse or adapt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor the Gamebook Activity page">
    Regularly check the Gamebook Activity page to ensure actions completed successfully and catch any failures early.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
