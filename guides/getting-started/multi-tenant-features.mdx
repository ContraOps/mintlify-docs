---

ContraForce is purpose-built for MSPs and MSSPs managing multiple customer environments. View incidents, run response actions, and monitor security posture across all your tenants—without switching between portals.

<Info>
  Whether you manage 5 tenants or 500, ContraForce scales with your business. All multi-tenant features are included in the platform at no additional cost.
</Info>

## Why Multi-Tenant Matters

Traditional security tools force analysts to log into each customer environment separately. ContraForce eliminates this friction:

## Command Dashboard: Your Central Hub

The **Command Dashboard** is the heart of ContraForce's multi-tenant capabilities. It provides a unified view of all security incidents across your managed tenants.

<Frame>
  ![Command Dashboard multi-tenant view](/images/Command.svg)
</Frame>

### What You Can See

| Function                     | Multi-Tenant Capability                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Multi-Tenant Dropdown**    | Filter down on one or many workspaces in seconds |
| **Closed Incident Trends**   | Closed incidents trends across workspaces        |
| **Incident Rule Trends**     | Detections triggered by rules across workspaces  |
| **Latest Gamebook Activity** | Recent response actions across workspaces        |

### Default Behavior

By default, the Command Dashboard displays data for all onboarded workspaces. This gives you immediate visibility into your entire customer base without any configuration.

<Tip>
  Start your day on the Command Dashboard to quickly identify which customers need attention. Trends and recent activity allow you to focus where it matters.
</Tip>

## Workspace Filtering

While seeing everything is powerful, sometimes you need to focus. The **Workspace Filter** lets you customize your view.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Filter">
    Click the workspace dropdown in the top navigation bar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Workspaces">
    Check the workspaces you want to display (one, several, or all)
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Filtered Data">
    All dashboard cards and tables update to show only selected workspaces
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  ![Workspace filter selection](/multi-tenant-filter-command-dashboard.png)
</Frame>

### Filter Persistence

Your workspace selection **persists as you navigate** between pages in ContraForce:

- Command Page → Endpoints Page → Gamebooks Page
- Your selected workspaces remain active throughout your session
- No need to re-select filters on each page

<Info>
  This persistence is especially useful when you're focused on a specific customer's issues and need to investigate across multiple ContraForce features.
</Info>

### Additional Filters

Beyond workspace filtering, you can further refine the Incidents table by:

| Filter       | Options                          | Use Case                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Severity** | High, Medium, Low, Informational | Prioritize critical incidents |
| **Status**   | New, Active, Closed              | Focus on open investigations  |
| **Module**   | Sentinel, Defender XDR           | Filter by security product    |

## Multi-Tenant Incident Management

Managing incidents across tenants follows the same workflow—but with added context about which customer is affected.

### Incident Table Columns

The Incidents table includes workspace identification:

| Column             | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Severity**       | Incident severity level                       |
| **Workspace**      | Which customer/tenant the incident belongs to |
| **Incident Title** | Description of the incident                   |
| **Incident ID**    | Unique identifier (click to investigate)      |
| **Creation Time**  | When the incident was detected                |
| **Status**         | Current investigation state                   |
| **Owner**          | Assigned analyst                              |

### Bulk Operations Across Tenants

You can perform bulk actions on incidents from multiple tenants simultaneously:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Incidents">
    Check incidents from any combination of workspaces
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Update Incidents">
    Open the bulk action dialog
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    Assign owner, change status, or close—all in one action
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  When performing bulk operations, verify you've selected the correct incidents. The workspace column helps you confirm which customers are affected.
</Warning>

## Multi-Tenant Endpoint Management

The **Endpoints Page** extends multi-tenant visibility to your device inventory.

### Unified Device View

See all endpoints from all tenants in a single table:

| Column             | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Workspace**      | Which customer owns the device |
| **Device Name**    | Endpoint hostname              |
| **Exposure Level** | Risk assessment from Defender  |
| **OS Platform**    | Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.    |
| **Health State**   | Device health status           |
| **Last Seen**      | Most recent check-in time      |

### Cross-Tenant Endpoint Actions

Run Defender for Endpoint actions on any device, regardless of tenant:

- Isolate device
- Run antivirus scan
- Collect investigation package
- Restrict app execution

<Tip>
  Use the workspace filter to focus on a specific customer's endpoints when troubleshooting device-specific issues.
</Tip>

## Multi-Tenant Gamebook Activity

Track automated response actions across your entire customer base.

### Gamebook Activity Card

The Command Page shows **Latest Gamebook Activity** with:

- **Workspace** — Which customer the action was performed on
- **Status** — Success, Failed, Pending Approval
- **Incident** — Linked incident ID
- **Owner** — Who initiated the action

### Approval Workflows

When Gamebook actions require approval, you can manage all pending requests from one location:

1. Navigate to the **Gamebook Activity** tab
2. View pending approvals across all tenants
3. Approve or reject with full context

## Workspace Management

The **Workspaces Page** provides administrative control over your tenants.

### Pre-Onboarding

Prepare customer environments before full deployment:

- Create workspace placeholders
- Configure initial settings
- Streamline the onboarding process

### Post-Onboarding Management

After onboarding, manage workspace configurations:

- View onboarding status
- Access workspace settings
- Monitor integration health
