The Command Dashboard is ContraForce's mission control center—a unified dashboard that gives you complete visibility into security incidents, gamebooks queued, and human and agent actions that are audited—across all your managed tenants.

## Overview

The Command Dashboard serves as your central hub for overseeing multiple Microsoft tenants through a single, intuitive dashboard. By default, it displays data for all onboarded tenants, with the option to customize your view by filtering specific workspaces.

<Callout icon="pencil">
  The Command Dashboard is designed for MSPs, MSSPs, and security teams managing tenants and environments. All data updates in real-time as incidents are detected and resolved.
</Callout>

## Dashboard Cards

The Command Dashboard features four key data cards that provide at-a-glance insights into your security posture:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Closed Incident Tracker" icon="chart-pie-simple">
    Displays the number of incidents based on severity and total incidents closed across workspaces. Filter workspaces to see incidents per workspace. 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incident Trends" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    Shows closed incident trends based on classification as well as incident rule trends based on last detections triggered over time. 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Member Activity" icon="people-group">
    See how your humans and agents are performing in one place. Track incidents managed by users based on incident severity level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gamebook History" icon="rectangle-history">
    View all queued gamebooks that are processing or awaiting for approval. Click any incident to review and approve gamebook runs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Incidents Table

The Incidents table is the heart of the Command Dashboard, displaying all security incidents across your connected workspaces.

### Table Columns

| Column             | Description                                                |

| **Severity**       | Incident severity level (High, Medium, Low, Informational) |
| **Workspace**      | The tenant/workspace where the incident occurred           |
| **Incident Title** | Brief description of the incident                          |
| **Incident ID**    | Unique identifier (click to view details)                  |
| **Creation Time**  | When the incident was first detected                       |

### Filtering Options

You can filter the incidents table by:

- **Workspace** — Select specific workspaces to focus on
- **Severity** — Filter by High, Medium, Low, or Informational
- **Status** — Show only New, Active, or Closed incidents

### Bulk Actions

Select multiple incidents to perform bulk operations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Incidents">
    Use the checkboxes to select one or more incidents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Action">
    Select an action from the bulk actions menu (e.g., assign owner, change status)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    Confirm to apply the changes to all selected incidents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workspace Filtering

The workspace filter at the top of the Command Dashboard allows you to customize your view:

1. Click the **Workspace Filter** dropdown
2. Select one or more workspaces to display
3. Your selection persists as you navigate to other pages in ContraForce

<Tip>
  Your workspace filter selection is maintained across all ContraForce pages during your session. This allows you to focus on specific customers without re-selecting filters on each page.
</Tip>

## Accessing Incident Details

1. Locate the incident in the Incidents table
2. Click the **Incident ID** (hyperlinked)
3. The Incident Details page opens with full investigation capabilities
