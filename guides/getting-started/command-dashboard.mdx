The Command Dashboard is ContraForce's mission control center—a unified dashboard that gives you complete visibility into security incidents, gamebooks queued, and human and agent actions that are audited—across all your managed tenants.

## Overview

The Command Dashboard serves as your central hub for overseeing multiple Microsoft tenants through a single, intuitive dashboard. By default, it displays data for all onboarded tenants, with the option to customize your view by filtering specific workspaces.

  The Command Dashboard is designed for MSPs, MSSPs, and security teams managing tenants and environments. All data updates in real-time as incidents are detected and resolved.

## Dashboard Cards

The Command Dashboard features four key data cards that provide at-a-glance insights into your security posture:

The Incidents table is the heart of the Command Dashboard, displaying all security incidents across your connected workspaces.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workspace Filtering

The workspace filter at the top of the Command Dashboard allows you to customize your view:
