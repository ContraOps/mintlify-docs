## 1. Workspace Filtering

The Command Page allows you to customize which incidents are displayed by filtering on Workspace, Severity, and Status. These filters persist as you navigate between pages in ContraForce.

### Setting Your Workspace Filter

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Filter">
    Click the workspace dropdown menu in the top bar of the Command Page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Workspaces">
    Choose one or more workspaces to display
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Filtered Results">
    The Incidents table updates to show only incidents from selected workspaces
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Additional Filters

Beyond workspace filtering, you can further refine your view:

| Filter       | Options                          | Use Case                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Severity** | High, Medium, Low, Informational | Focus on critical incidents first    |
| **Status**   | New, Active, Closed              | View only incidents requiring action |
| **Module**   | Sentinel, Defender XDR           | Filter by security product           |

<Tip>
  When filtering by status, you'll see statuses organized by module (Sentinel, Defender XDR, etc.). This helps you quickly identify incidents by source.
</Tip>

## 2. Incident Assignment

3. Select an analyst from the list of portal users

### Bulk Assignment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Incidents">
    Check the boxes next to incidents you want to update
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Update Incidents">
    Click the "Update Incidents" button in the table header
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Owner and Status">
    Choose the assignee and optionally update the status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    Confirm to apply changes to all selected incidents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Gamebook Responses

Gamebooks are pre-built and custom response actions that let you remediate threats with a single click.

<Info>
  Available Gamebook actions are determined by the entity types present in the incident. ContraForce automatically suggests relevant actions based on what it detects.
</Info>

### Using Suggested Gamebooks

If a Gamebook has been previously executed for similar incidents, ContraForce suggests it automatically:

<Frame>
  ![Suggested Gamebook](/images/suggested-gamebook.png)
</Frame>

### Creating a Custom Gamebook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Workbench">
    Click the dropdown next to "Edit" and select **Create New Gamebook**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Available Actions">
    Click entity icons in the Entity Graph to see available response actions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Your Response">
    - Use the arrows to navigate through action options
    - Click the green **\+** icon to add an action
    - Click the red **-** icon to remove an action
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">
    Click **Run Gamebook** to execute all selected actions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  ![Gamebook Workbench](/images/gamebook-workbench.png)
</Frame>

### Gamebook Approval Workflow

Some Gamebook actions require approval before execution:

<Warning>
  Actions with a **red lock icon** require approval from a user with appropriate permissions in the tenant.
</Warning>

**To request approval:**

1. Build your Gamebook as usual
2. Click **Request Gamebook Approval** (instead of Run Gamebook)
3. The request is sent to authorized approvers

**To approve a Gamebook:**

- Approvers can approve directly from the incident, or
- Use the **Gamebook Activity** tab to review and approve pending requests

## 5. Incident Closure

After completing your investigation and response, close the incident with proper documentation.

### Quick Close from Gamebook

After a Gamebook completes, a green **Close Incident** button appears at the bottom of the entity graph:

<Frame>
  ![Close Incident dialog](/images/close-incident-dialog.png)
</Frame>

### Closure Fields

| Field                     | Options                                                      | Purpose                                      |
