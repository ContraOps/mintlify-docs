## 1. Workspace Filtering

### Setting Your Workspace Filter

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Filter">
    Click the workspace dropdown menu in the top bar of the Command Page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Workspaces">
    Choose one or more workspaces to display
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Filtered Results">
    The Incidents table updates to show only incidents from selected workspaces
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

### Additional Filters

Beyond workspace filtering, you can further refine your view:

| Filter       | Options                          | Use Case                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Severity** | High, Medium, Low, Informational | Focus on critical incidents first    |
| **Status**   | New, Active, Closed              | View only incidents requiring action |
| **Module**   | Sentinel, Defender XDR           | Filter by security product           |

<Tip>
  When filtering by status, you'll see statuses organized by module (Sentinel, Defender XDR, etc.). This helps you quickly identify incidents by source.
</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Update Incidents">
    Click the "Update Incidents" button in the table header
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Owner and Status">
    Choose the assignee and optionally update the status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    Confirm to apply changes to all selected incidents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Gamebook Responses

Gamebooks SOP driven AI-generated and human created response actions that let you quickly respond to incidents.

<Info>
  Available Gamebook actions are determined by the entity types present in the incident. Agents automatically suggests relevant actions based on the output of the investigation and inciden classification.
</Info>

### Using Suggested Gamebooks

If a Gamebook has been previously executed for similar incidents, agents suggest it automatically:

### Creating a Custom Gamebook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Workbench">
    Click the dropdown next to "Edit" and select **Create New Gamebook**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Available Actions">

    - Click the red **-** icon to remove an action
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">
    Click **Approve Gamebook** to execute all selected actions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Gamebook Approval Workflow

Some Gamebook actions require approval before execution:

<Warning>
  Actions with a **red lock icon** require approval from a user with appropriate permissions in the tenant.
</Warning>

**To request approval:**

1. Build your Gamebook as usual
2. Click **Request Gamebook Approval** (instead of Run Gamebook)
3. The request is sent to authorized approvers

**To approve a Gamebook:**

## 5. Incident Closure

After completing your investigation and response, close the incident with proper documentation.
