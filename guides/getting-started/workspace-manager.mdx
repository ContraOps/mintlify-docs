The Workspaces Page is your administrative control center for managing customer tenants. Pre-onboard new customers before deployment, configure module settings, and manage integrations—all from one place.

<Info>
  Workspaces represent individual customer tenants in ContraForce. Each workspace has its own data, configurations, and user permissions.

## Permission Consent

Some features require explicit consent to Microsoft enterprise applications.

### Why Consent is Required

ContraForce uses Microsoft Graph API and other APIs to:

- Read security alerts and incidents
- Execute response actions (isolate devices, disable users)
- Access log data for analysis

These permissions must be granted by a tenant administrator.

### Granting Consent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Workspace Configuration">
    Click the edit icon for the workspace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Consent Section">
    Look for the **Consent** or **Permissions** area
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Consent Button">
    A Microsoft authentication window opens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign In as Admin">
    Sign in with a Global Administrator or appropriate admin role
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Accept">
    Review the requested permissions and click Accept
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Consent requires administrator privileges in the customer's Microsoft tenant. Work with your customer's IT team if you don't have admin access.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent naming conventions">
    Name workspaces consistently (e.g., "CustomerName - Primary") so they're easy to identify in filters and reports.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pre-onboard before customer meetings">
    Create pre-onboarded workspaces before onboarding calls so you can complete setup efficiently during the meeting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify consent status regularly">
    Periodically check that all required permissions are still consented. Token expirations or policy changes can affect access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document module configurations">
    Keep records of which modules and settings are enabled for each customer for support and renewal conversations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review inactive workspaces">
    Periodically review workspaces that haven't received data recently. This may indicate connector issues or offboarded customers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
