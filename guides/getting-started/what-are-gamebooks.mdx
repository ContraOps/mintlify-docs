title: "What are Gamebooks?"
description: "Automate incident response with AI-generated response actions. Gamebooks let you isolate devices, disable users, block IPs, and more—without manual intervention."
---

Gamebooks are SOP-driven incident response workflows powered by ContraForce's response engine, IRIS. Instead of manually logging into multiple consoles to contain a threat, you can execute proven response actions with a single-click across any workspace. 

<Info>
  Think of Gamebooks as your incident response playbook—automated. Select the actions you need, click run, and ContraForce handles the execution across your integrated security tools.
</Info>

## Why Gamebooks?

Traditional incident response requires analysts to:

1. Identify affected entities (users, devices, IPs)
2. Log into each security tool separately
3. Manually execute containment actions
4. Document what was done

**Gamebooks compress this into seconds:**

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="One Click" icon="mouse-pointer">
    Execute multiple actions across tools instantly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent" icon="check-double">
    Same response every time—no missed steps
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auditable" icon="clipboard-list">
    Complete history of every action taken
  </Card>

## Building a Gamebook

Creating a Gamebook is intuitive—select entities, choose actions, and execute.

### Step 1: Select an Entity

Click an entity in the **Entity Graph** (user, device, IP, etc.). The action carousel appears showing available response actions.

<Frame>
  ![Entity selection in Gamebook](/images/gamebook-entity-selection.png)
</Frame>

### Step 2: Add Actions

- Use the **arrows** to browse available actions
- Click the **green + icon** to add an action to your Gamebook
- Click the **red - icon** to remove an action

### Step 3: Repeat for Other Entities

Select additional entities and add their actions. You can build comprehensive response workflows targeting multiple entity types.

### Step 4: Review & Execute

Your selected actions appear in the **Gamebook Card**:

<Frame>
  ![Gamebook actions queue](/images/gamebook-actions-queue.png)
</Frame>

| Column     | Description                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Action** | The response action to be performed |
| **Entity** | Target of the action                |
| **Status** | "Pending" before execution          |

Click **Run Gamebook** to execute all actions.

## Gamebook Execution Status

After clicking Run Gamebook, monitor the execution:

| Status       | Meaning                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Pending**  | Action queued, not yet started |
| **Running**  | Action currently executing     |
| **Finished** | Action completed successfully  |
| **Failed**   | Action encountered an error    |

<Frame>
  ![Gamebook execution status](/images/gamebook-execution-status.png)
</Frame>

<Warning>
  If an action fails, check the Gamebook Activity page for error details. Common causes include permission issues or connectivity problems with the target system.
</Warning>

---

## Gamebook Approval Workflow

Some actions are too impactful to execute without oversight. These require approval before running.

### How to Identify Approval-Required Actions

Actions requiring approval display a **red lock icon** in the carousel.

<Frame>
  ![Approval required indicator](/images/gamebook-approval-required.png)
</Frame>

### Requesting Approval

When your Gamebook includes locked actions:

1. Build your Gamebook as usual
2. The button changes to **Request Gamebook Approval**
3. Click to submit the request
4. Status shows **Waiting Approval**

### Approving Gamebooks

Users with approval permissions can approve from:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Incident Summary" icon="file-lines">
    Open the incident and approve directly from the Gamebook status
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gamebooks Page" icon="list-check">
    Review all pending approvals in one centralized location
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Once approved, the Gamebook executes automatically.

## Gamebook History

Track all Gamebook activity across your environment from the dedicated **Gamebooks Page**.

### Accessing Gamebook History

Click the **Gamebooks icon** (triangle) in the navigation bar—it's the 2nd icon from the top.

<Frame>
  ![Gamebooks page navigation](/images/gamebooks-page-navigation.png)
</Frame>

### What You Can See

The Gamebooks page shows:

| Filter               | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Completed**        | Successfully executed Gamebooks |
| **Waiting Approval** | Pending approval requests       |
| **Failed**           | Gamebooks with errors           |

### Viewing Details

Click the **dropdown arrow** on any row to expand and see:

- Individual action results
- Execution timestamps
- Error messages (if failed)
- Entity details

<Frame>
  ![Gamebook history expanded view](/images/gamebook-history-expanded.png)
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Use the workspace filter to view Gamebook history for specific tenants. This is useful when reviewing activity for a particular customer.
</Tip>

## Unsupported Entities

Not all entity types support Gamebook actions due to technical limitations with source integrations.

If an entity doesn't support actions, you'll see an error message:

<Frame>
  ![Unsupported entity message](/images/gamebook-unsupported-entity.png)
</Frame>

**Common reasons:**

- Integration doesn't expose response APIs
- Entity type not yet supported
- Permissions not configured for response actions

<Note>
  ContraForce continuously adds new integrations and actions. If you need specific response capabilities, contact [support@contraforce.com](mailto:support@contraforce.com) to discuss your requirements.
