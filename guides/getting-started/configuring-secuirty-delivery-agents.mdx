title: "Configuring Security Delivery Agents"
description: "Configure and use Security Delivery Agents to automate incident investigation and response through a phased adoption approach."
---

Security Delivery Agents (SDAs) automate incident investigation and response within ContraForce. This guide walks you through configuring agents using a phased approach, allowing you to gradually increase automation as you become comfortable with agent capabilities.

<Info>
  Security Delivery Agents follow a three-phase adoption model: manual execution, automatic execution based on severity, and automatic gamebook execution. This progressive approach helps you build confidence in agent behavior before enabling full automation.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Security Delivery Agents, ensure you meet the following requirements.

| Requirement               | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Center Deployed** | Microsoft Foundry infrastructure must be provisioned    |
| **ContraForce Roles**     | Organizational Admin and Workspace Owner roles required |

<Warning>
  Prerequisites to Configure Security Delivery Agents:

  - Agent Center must be fully deployed in your environment
  - ContraForce Role: Organizational Admin
  - ContraForce Workspace Role: Owner
</Warning>

## Phase 1: Manual Agent Execution

In this initial phase, you manually select individual incidents and trigger the agent to run investigations. This allows you to evaluate agent performance before enabling automation.

### Running Agent Investigation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an Incident">
    Navigate to the incident you want to investigate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Actions Menu">
    Select **Actions** from the incident toolbar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Investigation Type">
    Select one of the following options:

    - **Run Agent Investigation** — Agent analyzes the incident and provides findings without taking remediation actions
    - **Run Agent Investigation and Response** — Agent analyzes the incident and executes recommended response actions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Examine the agent's findings and recommendations
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Investigation Options

| Option                                   | Description                        | When to Use                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Run Agent Investigation**              | Analysis only, no response actions | When you want to review findings before taking action     |
| **Run Agent Investigation and Response** | Analysis plus automated response   | When you trust the agent to execute appropriate responses |

<Tip>
  Start with investigation-only runs to understand how the agent analyzes your specific incident types before enabling response actions.
</Tip>

## Phase 2: Automatic Execution Based on Severity

Once you're comfortable with agent behavior, configure automatic execution based on incident severity and status.

### Configuring Automatic Execution

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agent Center">
    Open **ContraForce Agent Center** from the main navigation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Mode to On Queue">
    Change the **Mode** setting to **On Queue** to enable automatic processing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Status Filters">
    Select which incident statuses trigger automatic agent execution:

    - **New** — Agent runs on newly created incidents
    - **Active** — Agent runs on incidents currently being worked
    - **Closed** — Agent runs on closed incidents for retrospective analysis
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Apply your settings to activate automatic execution
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Status Filter Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New">
    **Process new incidents automatically:**

    - Agent triggers immediately when incidents are created
    - Provides rapid initial triage and analysis
    - Recommended for high-volume environments
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Active">
    **Process incidents under investigation:**

    - Agent assists with ongoing investigations
    - Provides additional context and recommendations
    - Useful for augmenting analyst workflows
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Closed">
    **Process closed incidents:**

    - Agent performs retrospective analysis
    - Identifies missed indicators or patterns
    - Supports continuous improvement efforts
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Phase 3: Automatic Gamebook Execution

In this advanced phase, you enable the agent to automatically execute gamebooks based on confidence thresholds.

### Enabling Automatic Gamebook Execution

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agent Center">
    Open **ContraForce Agent Center** from the main navigation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Gamebook Execution">
    Toggle **Allow Agent to run gamebooks** to enabled
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Confidence Level">
    Configure the confidence threshold that determines when the agent automatically executes gamebook actions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Apply your settings to activate automatic gamebook execution
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Confidence Levels

| Confidence Level | Behavior                                            | Recommended For                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**         | Agent requires strong evidence before taking action | Production environments, sensitive systems        |
| **Medium**       | Balanced approach between automation and caution    | Most standard deployments                         |
| **Low**          | Agent takes action with less certainty              | Test environments, high-volume low-risk scenarios |

<Warning>
  Lower confidence thresholds result in more aggressive automation. Start with higher thresholds and adjust based on observed accuracy and your risk tolerance.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                          | Possible Cause               | Solution                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent not processing incidents | Mode not set to On Queue     | Verify Mode is set to On Queue in Agent Center        |
| Gamebooks not executing        | Feature not enabled          | Confirm "Allow Agent to run gamebooks" is toggled on  |
| Too many automated actions     | Confidence threshold too low | Increase confidence level setting                     |
| Agent missing incidents        | Status filters misconfigured | Review and adjust status filter selections            |
| Investigation not starting     | Missing permissions          | Verify Organizational Admin and Workspace Owner roles |
