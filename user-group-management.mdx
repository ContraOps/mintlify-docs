description: "Add users to ContraForce, assign roles, and control access permissions across your organization and workspaces."
---

ContraForce provides flexible user management with role-based access control. Add users from your Entra ID directory, assign organizational and workspace roles, and control exactly what each team member can access.

<Info>
ContraForce integrates with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to pull user identities. Users must exist in Entra ID before they can be added to ContraForce.

## Adding Users During Onboarding

The easiest time to add users is during the initial ContraForce onboarding process.

### Onboarding Wizard

When you deploy ContraForce modules, the Onboarding Wizard provides the first opportunity to add users:

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select User">
    Click the **User** dropdown to see available users from your Entra ID directory
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Name">
    Confirm the first and last name displayed matches the intended user
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Role">
    Select the appropriate workspace role from the dropdown
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add More Users">
    Repeat for additional users, or continue with onboarding
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Add at least one Admin user during onboarding. This ensures you have full access to manage the workspace after setup is complete.
</Tip>

## Managing Users After Onboarding

## User Groups

Simplify access management by organizing users into groups.

### Benefits of Groups

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Bulk Assignment" icon="users">
    Assign workspace access to multiple users at once
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easier Management" icon="list-check">
    Update group membership instead of individual users
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Access" icon="shield-check">
    Ensure team members have the same permissions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Creating Groups

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Groups">
    Go to **Settings** > **Groups**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Group">
    Click **Add Group** and enter a name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Members">
    Search for and add users to the group
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to Workspaces">
    Assign the group to workspaces with appropriate roles
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assigning Users to Workspaces

Users need workspace assignments to access customer data.

### Individual Assignment

1. Open the workspace settings
2. Navigate to **Users** or **Access**
3. Click **Add User**
4. Select the user and assign a workspace role
5. Save changes

### Group Assignment

1. Open the workspace settings
2. Navigate to **Groups** or **Access**
3. Click **Add Group**
4. Select the group and assign a workspace role
5. All group members inherit access

<Tip>
Use groups for teams that need access to the same set of workspaces. This makes onboarding new team members faster—just add them to the appropriate group.
</Tip>

## Managing Existing Users

### Viewing User Details

Click any user in the User Management list to view:

- Assigned organizational role
- Workspace assignments and roles
- Group memberships
- Last login time

### Editing User Roles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select User">
    Click the user in the User Management list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Roles">
    Modify organizational or workspace roles as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply the new permissions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Removing Users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select User">
    Click the user you want to remove
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Remove">
    Click the **Remove User** or **Delete** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the removal when prompted
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Removing a user revokes all their access to ContraForce immediately. This action cannot be undone—you'll need to re-add the user if you want to restore access.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Follow the principle of least privilege">
    Assign the minimum role necessary for each user's job function. Start with Incident Analyst and escalate to Responder or Admin only when needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use groups for team-based access">
    Create groups that mirror your team structure (e.g., "Tier 1 Analysts", "Senior Responders"). This simplifies access management as team members change.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audit user access regularly">
    Review user assignments quarterly to ensure former team members have been removed and current roles are still appropriate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document role assignments">
    Maintain records of who has access to which workspaces and why. This helps with compliance audits and access reviews.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Separate admin duties">
    Don't give everyone Admin access. Reserve Admin roles for users who genuinely need to manage configurations and other users.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Can't see Add User button** | Missing User Admin or Org Admin role | Contact your administrator for elevated permissions |
| **User not found in dropdown** | User doesn't exist in Entra ID | Verify user exists in Microsoft Entra ID |
| **Consent flow fails** | Insufficient admin privileges | Use Global Administrator or appropriate admin account |
| **User can't access workspace** | No workspace assignment | Assign user directly or via group to the workspace |
| **User has wrong permissions** | Incorrect role assignment | Edit user and assign correct workspace role |
