title: "Entity Insights"
description: "Enrich your investigations with detailed entity insights. View sign-in logs, audit trails, threat intelligence, and related incidents for users, devices, IPs, and more."
---

Entity Insights provide rich context during incident investigations. Instead of switching between tools to gather information about affected users, devices, or IP addresses, ContraForce surfaces relevant data directly within the incident view.

<Info>
  Available insights vary by entity type and your connected data sources. The more integrations you have enabled, the richer your entity insights will be.

## Related Incidents

The **Related Incidents** insight is available for all entity types and shows other incidents where the same entity appears.

### Why This Matters

- **Pattern Detection** — Identify if an entity is repeatedly involved in security events
- **Attack Chain Analysis** — Understand how an attacker moved through your environment
- **Scope Assessment** — Determine the full impact of a compromise
- **False Positive Identification** — Recognize legitimate activity that triggers multiple alerts

### Using Related Incidents

| Column          | Description                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Incident ID** | Click to open the related incident |
| **Title**       | Brief description of the incident  |
| **Severity**    | High, Medium, Low, Informational   |
| **Status**      | Current state of the incident      |
| **Created**     | When the incident was detected     |

<Tip>
  If you see the same entity in multiple high-severity incidents, prioritize investigating that entity—it may indicate an active compromise.
</Tip>

## Threat Intelligence Enrichment

Some entity insights include threat intelligence from integrated sources.

### Supported Enrichments

| Entity Type    | Threat Intel Data                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IP Address** | Reputation, malicious activity history, blocklist status |
| **File/Hash**  | VirusTotal detections, malware family, first seen date   |
| **URL/Domain** | Reputation, phishing indicators, domain age              |
| **User**       | Compromised credential alerts, risk indicators           |

<Info>
  Threat intelligence enrichment requires integration with tools like VirusTotal or Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence. Contact your administrator to enable additional enrichment sources.
</Info>

## Integration-Specific Insights

Available insights depend on which integrations are connected to your workspace.

### Microsoft Defender XDR

- Device timeline and alerts
- User sign-in and audit logs
- Email trace and threat detection
- File and URL analysis

### Microsoft Sentinel

- Log Analytics query results
- Custom entity enrichments
- Watchlist matches
- Threat intelligence indicators

### Third-Party Integrations

Additional insights may be available based on your connected tools:

- **CrowdStrike** — Device details, detection history
- **SentinelOne** — Agent status, threat indicators
- **QRadar** — Offense correlation, log data

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Related Incidents">
    Always check Related Incidents first. If an entity appears in multiple incidents, it may be the key to understanding the attack scope.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Correlate sign-in anomalies">
    Compare sign-in logs with the incident timeline. Look for unusual locations, impossible travel, or authentication failures before the incident.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use audit logs for privilege escalation">
    When investigating compromised accounts, review audit logs for privilege changes, group membership modifications, or unusual administrative actions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check device timeline for malware">
    For device-based incidents, the timeline shows the sequence of events leading to detection—crucial for understanding initial access and lateral movement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document key findings">
    Copy important insight data to incident comments for team visibility and post-incident documentation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                     | Possible Cause                      | Solution                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No insights available** | Entity type not supported           | Check the Capabilities Matrix for supported entities   |
| **Missing sign-in logs**  | Entra ID integration not connected  | Verify Azure AD/Entra ID connector status              |
| **Empty device timeline** | Defender for Endpoint not onboarded | Confirm MDE integration is enabled                     |
| **No threat intel data**  | Enrichment source not configured    | Contact admin to enable VirusTotal or other TI sources |
