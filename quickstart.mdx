The Command Page is ContraForce's mission control center—a unified dashboard that gives you complete visibility into security incidents, gamebooks queued, and human and agent actions that are audited—across all your managed tenants.

## Overview

The Command Page serves as your central hub for overseeing multiple Microsoft tenants through a single, intuitive dashboard. By default, it displays data for all onboarded tenants, with the option to customize your view by filtering specific workspaces.

<Info>
  The Command Page is designed for MSSPs and service providers managing multiple customer environments. All data updates in real-time as incidents are detected and resolved.

## Dashboard Cards

The Command Page features four key data cards that provide at-a-glance insights into your security posture:

The Incidents table is the heart of the Command Page, displaying all security incidents across your connected workspaces.

  </Step>
